FileSystem - Milestone Two  - Due November 3, 2022

This will not be turned in.  You should be at the point where you have the file fsshell integrated into your file system and you can to make directory (md), list directory (ls), print working directory (pwd) and change directory (cd).

This means that the following functions must be implemented and functional:

    fs_setcwd
    fs_getcwd
    fs_isFile
    fs_isDir
    fs_mkdir
    fs_opendir
    fs_readdir
    fs_closedir
    fs_stat

And optimally complete

    fs_delete
    fs_rmdir
