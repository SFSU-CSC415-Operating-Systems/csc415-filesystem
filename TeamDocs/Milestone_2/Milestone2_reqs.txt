FileSystem - Milestone Two  - Due November 3, 2022

This will not be turned in.  You should be at the point where you have the file fsshell integrated into your file system and you can to make directory (md), list directory (ls), print working directory (pwd) and change directory (cd).

This means that the following functions must be implemented and functional:

    fs_parsePath    Mark    ParsePath returns a pointer to the directory that the element exists in.
    fs_setcwd       Peter
    fs_getcwd       Peter
    fs_isFile       Zeel
    fs_isDir        Zeel
    fs_mkdir        Zeel
    fs_opendir      Chengkai
    fs_readdir      Chengkai
    fs_closedir     Chengkai
    fs_stat         Mark

And optimally complete

    fs_delete       Mark
    fs_rmdir        Mark


ParsePath:
Returns a pointer to an array of directory entries (the directory).

Things we need to think about are:
When shell opens, we will be in the root directory (therefore we know the path).
When the user changes directory, the USER is putting in the path, so all we need 
to do is save what the user put in (of course, given that the path is valid).
This all means we can can just save the entire path and pass it around.

For all functions that we use the path in, let us standardize to the word "pathname"

fs_getcwd(char *pathname) {
    return pathname;
}
